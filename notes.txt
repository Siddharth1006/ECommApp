App.js vs index.js?
===================
index.js is the traditional and actual entry point for all node apps. 
Here in React it just has code of what to render and where to render.

App.js on the other hand has the root component of the react app because every view and component are handled with hierarchy in React, where <App /> is the top most component in the hierarchy. 
This gives you the feel that you maintain hierarchy in your code starting from App.js.

Other than that, you can have the App logic in the index.js file itself. 
But it's something related to conventions followed by the community using the library or framework. 
It always feels good to go along the community.

Js vs jsx?
=========
JS is simply a scripting language, adding functionality into your website. 
JSX is an addition to the JavaScript syntax which is a mixture of both HTML and JavaScript. 
Both JS and JSX are interchangeable but JSX makes the code easier to understand for users.

For using styled-components
---------------------------
npm i styled-components 
OR 
yarn add styled-components
Then you can use styled components easily.

Why use styled components?
=========================
1. Its easier to understand and reduces a lot div and classNames making code a lot simpler.

2. Also if we use a component(parent) className that is say "container" and it is fetching a another child component which uses 
a div and also has className as "container" then the react-app will show an error. This can cause development errors.
And to prevent this, react will take the styling of the parent component over the child component.

3. When we are using in small applications make a className and doing CSS on it is ok. But for large and complex applications,
its better to use Styled-components.

To prevent all this we can use Styled-components.
